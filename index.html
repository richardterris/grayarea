									<h2>What is gray area?</h2>
									<p>Gray area is the space between our perspectives. Before we can fix any problems in our society, we need to understand those problems from each other's points of view. This website is a place to have conversations with people outside of your ethnicity, in the hope that we may all learn from each other.</p>
									<p>We believe that for real racial change, black and white people (and other races) have to work together to address the problems. Before you can fix a problem, you must understand what the problem is, and the only way to do that when it comes to problems between races, is to understand each other's perspective.</p>
									<p>The topic of those conversations is the gray area, and when black and white come together you get gray, hence the name of this site.</p>
									<p>While the application is being built, you are invited by the website creator to partake in discussions via email. You all have received your email with a link to this site, so that you may read the conversation instructions.</p>

								<h3>Instructions</h3>
								<ol id="instructions">
									<li>You will choose from a list of user-suggested topics</li>
									<li>You will then enter into a discussion with one person from a different ethnic background than you</li>
									<li>To protect privacy, all email replies will be sent to the email address provided by the site creator, and those replies will be forwarded to the other person in your conversation</li>
									<li>Person 1 (chosen by the site creator) will state their point of view by emailing the site creator.</li>
									<li>Person 2 (chosen by the site creator) will respond with what their understanding of Person 1's point is.</li>
									<li>Person 1 will either agree or disagree that Person 2 has understood their point. If they disagree, they will also provide further information to clarify their point</li>
									<li>Steps 5 and 6 will repeat until Person 1 agrees that Person 2 has understood their point</li>
									<li>Control moves to Person 2, who now provides their response</li>
									<li>Person 1 will respond with what their understanding of Person 2's point is.</li>
									<li>Person 2 will either agree or disagree that Person 1 has understood their point. If they disagree, they will also provide further information to clarify their point</li>
									<li>Steps 9 and 10 will repeat until Person 2 agrees that Person 1 has understood their point</li>
									<li>At any time, either Person can propose that they have either reached an agreement overall, or that they agree to disagree</li>
									<li>If they have chosen to agree to disagree, the conversation comes to an end</li>
									<li>If they have chosen that they agree, the other person has the opportunity to reject the agreement, and the conversation continues</li>
									<li>When the conversation has ended, a transcript of the conversation will be emailed to you and the other users who have signed up</li>
